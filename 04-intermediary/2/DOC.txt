The client sends the request to the intermediate (the servlet). 
The request is similar to a regular request to the end server except that it has a 'commission' header element that 
would tell the intermediate whether it should apply ('yes') or not (anything but 'yes') a -1 commission to processing
the difference (the calculator server is used for HI, Health Insurance, payments).
The intermediate gets the request, extracts the SOAP message from the input stream of the request, processes the header
element 'commission', then the element is detached and the message is passed through a SOAP connection to the end server.
After getting the end server response, the intermediate attaches a new 'commissioned' header element having as values 
'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of 'commission'. If the difference should be commissioned, the result of the 
difference is decremented in the body. The updated message is passed as a response to the client that processes it as
a usual end server response.
