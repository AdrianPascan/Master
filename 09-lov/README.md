Classes/properties **without namespaces** don't have a LOV (Linked Open Vocabularies) entry.

Because of **StarUML naming constraints**, the following patterns are used:

-   classes with a LOV entry: `<LOVNamespace>_<className>` ;

-   properties with a LOV entry: `<LOVNamespace>: <propertyName>` ;

-   properties of form `<propertyName> = <class>` are an instance/collection of instances of `<class>` class.
